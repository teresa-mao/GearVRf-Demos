# GearVRf-Demos

###gvr-complexscene
A simple sample which can contain as many bunnies as we want to make it complex


###gvr-inputsample
Demonstrates using a Mouse or Gamepad device with GVRf. The program makes use of the IO framework to create cursor objects that help implement user defined interaction with other objects in the scene graph.


###gvr-remote-scripting
The remote scripting sample enables the debug server and sets up a text object with the ipaddress of the phone so we know where to telnet into.
